Data Visualization

Interactive dashboards were created using a visualization tool (e.g., Power BI or Tableau), allowing the comparison of key indicators like operating profit and monthly revenue trends.


Performance Analysis

Comparative analysis was applied to identify top-performing products, channels, and regions, using bar charts, pie charts, and trend lines to support decision-making.
